The code in this repository allows to read the Double Gap (DG) events stored in a root file.

The events are of type DGEvent, which is defined in the files DGBuffers.[h,C].

loopDGEvent.C demonstrates how to loop over the events. The script contains extensive comments.

To run the macro do:
. shell> root -l
. root> .L DGBuffers.C++
. root> .L loopDGEvents.C
. root> eventLooper('input file name')
